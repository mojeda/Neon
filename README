NEON README UPDATED: DEC 2012
=====================================
Neon is a project which is still
in development. The intent of neon
is to be a fully usable control panel
for servers with multiple user support
and to offer easy to use tools for
building and maintaining websites.

==========================================
SETUP DIRECTIONS (FULL INSTALLER)
==========================================
As a precaution I would like to take the time
to make sure that if you have a copy of nginx,
mysql, php or apache installed on your server 
please DO NOT install NEON. NEON will overwrite
any configuration you have, delete files and
folders you may need and may without jusification
destroy anything and everything on your server.

As such please only install neon on a blank server/vps.

Copy & paste this command into SSH:

cd ~ && wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/BlueVM/Neon/develop/neon-installer.sh && chmod 777 neon-installer.sh && ./neon-installer.sh
